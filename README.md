## libqi dotnet bindings

This project supports Nao `qi` via dotnet sdk 9.0. Following the old repo these are x86 libraries.

### Checks

1. You need to add to your PATH environment variable the path to the directory where these can be found:
 - `qi.client.dll`
 - `qi.messaging.dll`

2. On windows, qi and qic `MUST` be compiled in release mode? Why?

### Usage

Once our v4 Nao is back on its feet, will perform testing of this code.
